# Payment channel server

WARNING: This is "alpha" quality demo software.

## Included programs

* `serverd`: Payment channel server. Run with `--init` to create db.
* `serveradm`: Server administration utility.
* `servercli`: Client utility, a thin wrapper over the RPC calls

Run with `--help` to get a command line summary.

Run the utilities with no arguments, to obtain a list of commands.

Server events are logged via the flexible 'winston' module.

See comments in example-serverd.cfg for further server configuration.
